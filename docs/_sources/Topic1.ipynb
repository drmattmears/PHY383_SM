    "# Topic 1 - Macroscopic systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the course we will study soft matter systems from the macroscopic level, first considering [what a soft matter system actually is](Topic1).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll then compare what happens to more traditional systems [(solids and liquids)](sec:C1_Shearing) when a shear force is applied, and see whether we can use these two systems together to model [viscoelasticity](sec:C1_Viscoelastic) which is more typical for a soft matter system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we'll look briefly into the wonderful world of [glasses](sec:Glasses), something that is particularly dear to my heart."
