These compositions are known as the **coexisting** compositions, and the line that is formed when the interaction parameter $\\chi$ is changed (normally by changing the temperature) is known as the binodal or **coexistence curve**.

All that is required is for a small local fluctuation to occur, which will occur due to the statistical nature of thermodynamics, that causes the system to phase separate. We would say that $\\phi_B$ composition is **unstable**. \n",

    "However for $\\phi_A$ (i.e. when the curvature is positive) any small fluctuations in phases will increase the free energy and so even though $\\phi_A$ does not have the lowest free energy possible, there needs to be a significant driving process to cause the system to phase separate; small scale fluctuations will not cause the system, but the system could phase separate out under the right conditions. As such we would call $\\phi_A$ **metastable**.\n",
