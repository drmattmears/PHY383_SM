    "## Rubber elasticity\n",
    "We have spent the past few sections considering polymers at the individual molecular level, and somewhat abstractly thought about how polymer chains behave in different concentrations. We can now take this knowledge of the molecular domain and see whether it can explain some of the macroscopic properties we covered at the start of the course when we examined [shearing of different materials](sec:C1_Shearing). We will first consider the elastic properties of rubber materials with the understanding that these materials are made up of many many polymer chains.\n",

    "This leads us to a nice point of convergence: can we understand why viscoelastic materials behave they way they do if we understand how long chain molecules of a characteristic size can move when also interacting with neighbouring molecules? The answer lies in how polymer chains in the melt are **entangled**, which (with a little thought) could come out from the data in {numref}`fig:C2_Colby`; short chain polymers behave more like small colloidal particles, but once the chains get to a certain length they are able to intertwine and entangle. An alternative view is that it is unlikely that a bunch of really short lengths of string mixed in a container will form a tangled mess, but this is very likely for long lengths of string."
