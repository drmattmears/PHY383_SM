At one extreme end we have no polymer chains whatsoever meaning the system is pure solvent. Next we have a **dilute** system in which the small number of polymer chains in the solutions are, on average, sufficiently separated that they do not interact with each other. We next have the **semi-dilute** where chains begin to overlap and interact, but there are still distinct regions of pure solvent. Next we have the **concentrated solution** in which the polymer chains **and** solvent are uniformly distributed in the solution. Finally we have the other extreme of a pure polymer system in which there is no solvent whatsoever.\n",

    "In the dilute regime the polymers do not follow random walk statistics as excluded volume effects cause the chain to swell. Somewhat counterintuitively, the system becomes easier to model as the solution becomes more and more concentrated; in the polymer melt and concentrated systems the chains follow **ideal** random walk statistics.\n",

    "We'll take an argument from Flory who considered the segment concentration $c$ across a one-dimensional 'slice' of our solution, which we will align along $x$. The excluded volume effect introduces an unfavourable energy of interaction that is proportional to the probability of two segments being close together, i.e. proportional to $c^2$. This leads to a force on the segments proportional to $c\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{d}c}{\\mathrm{d}x}$.\n",
