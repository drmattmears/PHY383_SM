    "## Size of ideal chain\n",
    "In this model we assume that our polymer chain is made up of $N$ units of individual length $a$. If we then attach a vector $\\textbf{a}_i$ to each unit pointing to the next (i.e. pointing from unit $i$ to $i+1$) unit then we are describing our polymer as a random walk in space. There is an important assumption here in that **the orientation of each unit is random and independent of the direction of any other unit**. An odd outcome of this is that it is possible for units of the chain to occupy the same space. This is why it is called an **ideal** chain, and we will address partly by considering the [effect of short-range interactions](sec:C2_IdealShort) and then in more depth when we consider what are termed [real chains](sec:C2_RealChain).\n",

In the two dimensional case shown in {numref}`fig:C2_IdealLattice` each vector has 4 possible directions (up, right, left, and down), and moves a single step in any of these direction. This step is denoted $\\textbf{a}_i$ and the size is equal to one lattice spacing.\n",

We shall now address this issue in part - the most substantial approach will be covered when we look at [the Real chain](sec:C2_RealChain).\n",

In other works we impose the restriction that $\\textbf{r}_{n+1}\\neq-\\textbf{r}_n$. Instead the $(n+1)$ vector must take one of the remaining $(z-1)$ directions at random. Thus the average value of $\\textbf{r}_{n+1}$ will not be zero for a given $\\textbf{r}_{n}$ because it can point along $\\textbf{r}_{n}$ but not $-\\textbf{r}_{n}$, creating an asymmetry in the possible configuration space.  \n",

In the two dimensional lattice case ({numref}`fig:C2_IdealLattice`) this additional factor would be $\\sqrt{2}$, for a three dimensional lattice this reduces to $\\sqrt{\\frac{6}{4}}=\\sqrt{1.5}$, and as we give each bond vector more possible directions (for example going beyond a simple cubic lattice) the factor $\\dfrac{z}{z-2}$ gets closer and closer to unity meaning the simple ideal case once again gives a very good model for a polymer chain."
