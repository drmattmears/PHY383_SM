abstract = {The glass transition temperature of thin polystyrene films has been measured as a function of film thickness. It is found that the glass transition decreases in temperature as the thickness of the film is reduced. The effect is not strongly molecular-weight dependent, ruling out chain confinement as the major cause, instead we suggest that at the surface of the glassy film a liquidlike layer exists whose size diverges as the glass transition temperature is approached from below. {\textcopyright} 1994 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract  = {We describe an investigation of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy into the diffusion of fluorescein-tagged dextran (FDEX) in a poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) hydrogel. The temperature dependence of FDEX diffusion is shown to follow Zimm behavior in pure water, and the decrease in the diffusion coefficient when in the PMAA hydrogel has been modeled. The addition of acid and alkali (HCl and NaOH, respectively) not only control the swelling and collapse of the hydrogel but also reveal a strong pH dependence of the dextran diffusion coefficient, which shows a (nonmonatonic) increase with pH. The addition of NaCl and CaCl 2 salts similarly showed evidence of network swelling, most notably at low salt concentration, but also that the diffusion coefficient within the gel at these low concentrations is larger than that in the equivalent solution without the hydrogel, indicating that the combination of hydrogel and salt works to increase the diffusion coefficient above that in pure water. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Polym Sci Part B: Polym Phys, 2012 The diffusion of molecules trapped within responsive hydrogels can be controlled by changing environmental conditions. Here, it is shown that poly(methacrylic acid) hydrogels respond to temperature, salt, and pH to alter the diffusion coefficient of dextran within the gel. The presence of ions in the surrounding environment cause significant swelling of the gel, with low ion concentrations providing the largest effect on both the mesh size of the gel and the diffusion of the dextran molecules.

More recently it has been proposed by Valanis \&amp; Landel that W may be expressible in terms of separate functions w(λi) of the principal extension ratios λi This hypo­ thesis appears to be borne out experimentally, and gives promise of a more accurate analysis of experimental measurements. Application to recent data enables w(λi) to be expressed as an explicit algebraic function, from which it appears that the earlier conclusions of Rivlin \&amp; Saunders require some modification in detail.},
