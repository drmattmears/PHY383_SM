    "# 1.2 Shearing a solid or liquid\n",
    "In the previous sections we have discussed the differences between hard and soft condensed matter in terms of a) the types of units (atoms versus long molecules) and b) the relative strength of inter-unit bonds. These are both valid distinctions (otherwise I wouldn't be including them here) but from a historical and pragmatic perspective they are very difficult to observe. In practice a great deal of the developments in understanding soft condensed matter came from observing the **macroscopic** properties of materials and developing theories and predictions of molecular systems and interactions that could lead to the properties we measure in the everyday world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently we are now going to turn our attention to the differences between hard- and soft- condensed matter at the macroscopic or **bulk** level. But to do so we need to consider the simple cases we are already familiar with, namely a Hookean solid (i.e. one that obeys Hooke's law) and a Newtonian liquid, and then we will consider materials that deviate away from one or both of these ideal materials."

    "We can now turn out attention to more complex liquids that are subjected to some applied stress. On the left hand side of figure {numref}`fig:C1_FluidTheory` the liquid is represented by a black box and is made up of individual yellow molecules. These molecules do not have any long range order and the interatomic / intermolecular distance is a range rather than a single value (some are closer together, others further apart). We then apply some shear stress such that the liquid deform (middle figure). In doing so the individual atoms or molecules are also moved and in some cases an atom or molecule, highlighted in red, finds itself much closer to its neighbours than would be expected in the unsheared case. These reduced distances means that the total interaction energy of this atom / molecule is high, and the system will want to change in order to minimise the energy of the system. We find that after some characteristic time $\\tau$ the 'trapped' molecule is able to escape the 'cage' formed by the too-close neighbours and relaxes into a new position that reduces the energy of interaction between that atom or molecule and the new neighbours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sounds logical. But can we construct some logical argument that allows us to quantify $\\tau$ in terms of other properties of the system, such as the temperature or interaction energy? Of course, otherwise this would be a short and pointless section! \n",
    "\n",
    "We start our argument by recognising that the trapped molecule is not simply sitting there waiting until it is time to hop out of the cage. Instead the molecule will be continuously vibrating within the cage, moving with a continuously changing that depends on the thermal energy of the molecule **and** the interaction energy between neighbours $\\epsilon$. What we have here is a statistical mechanics system, meaning we are interested in the **probability** that the molecule will be able to escape the cage by overcoming the energy barrier $\\epsilon$ and that this probability is given by the Boltzmann distribution. Thus the characteristic time to escape the cage is\n",

    "\\tau^{-1} \\sim \\nu\\,\\, \\text{exp}\\left(-\\frac{\\epsilon}{k_\\text{B}T}\\right)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The exact values for $\\nu$ and $\\epsilon$ will depend on the material we are studying but from a conceptual perspective we can get some understanding if we make some reasonable estimates about these parameters. As an order of magnitude argument is only what we are interested here, we assume that the frequency $\\nu$ is comparable to that of the frequency of phonons near the Brillouin zone boundary which are of order THz, or $10^{12}\\text{ s}^{-1}$. We then note that the upper limit on the energy barrier $\\epsilon$ must be the latent heat of vaporisation per molecule $\\epsilon'$ otherwise the molecule escapes the liquid entirely as a vapour. Experimental data shows that for many simple liquids the approximation $\\epsilon \\approx 0.4\\epsilon'$ is reasonable. Again we are interested in order of magnitudes so using the latent heat per molecule of water as $6.67\\times10^{-20}\\text{ J}$ means that $10^{-20}$ will suffice for a simple liquid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugging in these order of magnitude values tells us that the relaxation time of a simple liquid is of order $10^{-12}-10^{-10}\\text{ s}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Again let us stop here and think about the the implications of this, and to do so we should make reference back to {numref}`fig:C1_Viscoelastic`. There are two important conclusions we can draw, one which is fairly straightforward but the other is perhaps a little surprising.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the relaxation time, i.e. the characteristic time at which a viscoelastic material 'changes' from elastic to viscous, depends on two parameters; $\\nu$ which relates to the molecule itself and $\\epsilon$ that characterises the interaction between the molecule and its neighbours. So a viscoelastic material that has a long relaxation time will have molecules that, for reasons we will consider later, make fewer attempts to escape the cage or have a higher interaction energy with neighbouring molecules. The actual reason is somewhere between the two, but we will come back to this later in the course.\\\\\n",
    "The second and more surprising outcome from equation {eq}`eq:C1_tau` and the paragraph that follows is that water has a characteristic time $\\tau$. The implication here is that water also behaves like a viscoelastic material but only if you were to observe the response to shear at the subnanosecond domain. You might wonder why this is the case, and again we look back to $\\nu$ and $\\epsilon$ - you might start to wonder why water and simple liquids have small $\\tau$, and a reasonable hypothesis could be that the size of the molecule could play a part. **Hold that thought for now**.\n",

    "Combining equations {eq}`eq:C1_ViscTau` and {eq}`eq:C1_tau` gives\n",

    "meaning that the viscosity of our viscoelastic material in the domain of $t>\\tau$ varies **exponentially** with temperature. This is known as an **Arrhenius** form, named after the more common version in physical chemistry that gives an empirical model of how the rate constant of a chemical reaction depends on temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately this is not the end of the story. Some liquids do indeed follow an Arrhenius behaviour whereas others show what some call a \"super-Arrhenius\" type behaviour. The temperature dependence of viscosity in these liquids is much stronger than a simple exponential behaviour. Consider {numref}`fig:C1_StrongFragile`.\n",

    ":alt: Plot of normalised temperature against log of viscosity. A linear dependence is found for strong liquids (such as silicon dioxide, labelled by open triangle) whereas fragile liquids (glycerol (solid circles) and sucrose (solid triangles) do not show a linear relationship.\n",
    ":width: 60%\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "There are some liquids, known as strong liquids, whose viscosity-temperature depenence follows the Arrhenius form given in equation {eq}`eq:C1_Arrhenius`. Other liquids are more complex and show a non-linear relationship between $\\ln \\eta$ and $T^{-1}$ - these liquids are sometimes called **fragile** liquids.  \n",
    "Care needs to be taken with the horizontal axis. It is normalised such that unity refers to the temperature at which the liquid becomes rigid (glass - see next section) and values below 1 are temperatures **above** this glass temperature.  \n",
    "The strong liquid (open triangles) is $\\text{SiO}_2$ whereas the fraile liquid are glycerol (solid circles) and sucrose (solid triangles). Figure from Longinotti and Corti {cite:p}`Longinotti2008`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The axes in this figure are a typcial choice for studying the temperature dependence of viscosity. From equation {eq}`eq:C1_Arrhenius` it follows that plotting $\\ln \\eta$ against $\\frac{1}{T}$ should give a straight line with gradient equal to $\\dfrac{\\epsilon}{k_\\text{B}}$ and intercept $\\dfrac{G_0}{\\nu}$. Therefore any data that lies on a straight line on these axes is a liquid that shows Arrhenius-type behaviour. By plotting data from three different liquids in {numref}`fig:C1_StrongFragile` we immediately see that one of them shows Arrhenius-type behaviour associated with a simple liquid (in this case, $\\text{SiO}_2$) but two different sugars show a much stronger temperature dependence and are consquently not a simple liquid. Some authors call these **fragile** liquids though it is not used by everyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, remember not long ago I told you to hold that thought? Here we have some experimental data that does support our intuition that the size of the molecules may play a part in whether a liquid is simple or not. $\\text{SiO}_2$ is a relatively small molecule whereas sucrose ($\\text{C}_{12}\\text{H}_{22}\\text{O}_{11}$) is much larger - in terms of molar mass, sucrose is 6 times more massive. The two molecules are also rather different in shape too but that is something we will explore in much more detail in [Topic 2](Topic2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Even putting aside the fine detail regarding the role of molecule size and shape we can still gain some insight into the possible causes of the non-Arrhenius behaviour exhibited by some liquids and what happens to these materials when we cool them to a rigid but non-crystalline state known as a **[glass](sec:Glasses)**."
